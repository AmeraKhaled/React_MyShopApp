# Product Catalog App

## Overview

The **Product Catalog App** is a responsive and interactive web application built using **React** and **Django**. The app allows users to explore products, filter them by category, and view detailed product information. It offers a seamless browsing experience and utilizes a modern stack for both frontend and backend development. This project demonstrates my ability to develop full-stack applications by integrating React for the frontend and Django for the backend.

## Features

- **Product Listing**: Displays a list of products fetched from a backend API.
- **Category Filtering**: Allows users to filter products by category using query parameters in the URL.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive, providing an optimized viewing experience on all devices.
- **Dynamic Content**: Products are dynamically fetched from the server, with the ability to update based on category selection.
- **Interactive UI**: A clean, user-friendly interface powered by React and styled with inline styles.
